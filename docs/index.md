I am not a strong chess player - it's always seemed to me more like study than
play. However, I do like the ideas in chess: a ragtag army of pieces with
different moves, battling to protect their king. I wondered if I could take
those ideas that many players are already familiar with, and mix them together
with some newer game mechanics from the last 500 years of board game design.
This collection contains chess games I've designed with hidden information,
bluffing, deduction, role selection, and yes, zombies. They can all be played
with a standard chess set and common items like pencil and paper, coins, and
playing cards.

Hopefully, serious chess players can enjoy these as a light break between
regular chess games, and new chess players can use them as a gentler
introduction to the classic game. Players of different chess abilities that
might find a game of regular chess frustrating may enjoy exploring these games
together.

* [Zombie Chess][zombie-chess] is a game where you bury each piece you
    capture under one of your pieces. If you move off a buried piece, it
    comes back from the dead as a zombie. (2 players, chess set, coins,
    pencils, and paper)
* [Masquerade Chess][masquerade-chess] is a combination of chess and
    deduction games like Mastermind. Pieces move regularly, except when
    they capture. Start the game by choosing which capture moves each of
    your opponent's pieces will use, then try to deduce how each of your
    pieces can capture. (2 players, chess set, pencils, and paper)
* [Chess960][chess960] is a game designed by Bobby Fischer to mix up
    the game opening by randomly choosing your starting position. (2
    players, chess set, and deck of cards)
