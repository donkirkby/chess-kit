I am not a strong chess player - it's always seemed to me more like study than
play. However, I do like the ideas in chess: a ragtag army of pieces with
different moves, battling to protect their king. I wondered if I could take
those ideas that many players are already familiar with, and mix them together
with some newer game mechanics from the last 500 years of board game design.
This collection contains chess games I've designed with hidden information,
bluffing, deduction, role selection, and yes, zombies. They can all be played
with a standard chess set and common items like pencil and paper, coins, and
playing cards.

Hopefully, serious chess players can enjoy these as a light break between
regular chess games, and new chess players can use them as a gentler
introduction to the classic game. Players of different chess abilities that
might find a game of regular chess frustrating may enjoy exploring these games
together.

* [Zombie Chess] is a game where you bury each piece you capture under one of
    your pieces. If you move off a buried piece, it comes back from the dead as
    a zombie. (2 players, chess set, coins, pencils, and paper)
* [Masquerade Chess] is a combination of chess and deduction games like
    Mastermind. Pieces move regularly, except when they capture. Start the
    game by choosing which capture moves each of your opponent's pieces will
    use, then try to deduce how each of your pieces can capture. (2 players,
    chess set, pencils, and paper)
