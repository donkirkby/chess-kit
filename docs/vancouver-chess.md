title: Vancouver Chess
subtitle: Where to play it
---
When I was a kid, I remember seeing people playing chess outside the art gallery
and in shopping mall food courts, but when I went looking for games in the
last few years, I found them surprisingly elusive. I thought somebody would have
posted a list of regular public games, but I never found one. I guess I could be
that somebody, so here's a list of the chess games that I know about in
Vancouver, British Columbia. If you know of others, let me know on [Mastodon] or
by [e-mail]. For the ones I haven't tried, I include what I've heard from other
players.

While you're here, check out the collection of chess variants I've been
designing: [Chess Kit].
