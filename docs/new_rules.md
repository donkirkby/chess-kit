## Cloak and Dagger Chess
Start with pawns in their regular positions, but replace all other pieces with
numbered checkers. Then write down numbers and positions of other pieces. Pieces
move normally, and you have to deduce which of your opponent's pieces are which,
then capture their king.

At the start of your turn, you may guess the identity of one of your opponent's
cloaked pieces. If you guess correctly, you make two moves in the current turn.
If you guess incorrectly, your turn is over.

At the end of your turn, you may replace any number of your checkers with their
uncloaked chess pieces.
