## 2007 - Minor Confusion
Originally, I played Robert Abbott's Confusion several times with Kerry
Handscomb, where you don't know which of your pieces can make which moves. We
loved the idea of having to deduce your own pieces' moves, but we were
frustrated that a lot of the game came down to luck: who happened to find their
most powerful pieces first.

We designed a version with fewer pieces that had more balanced power, and called
it Minor Confusion. We even discussed the idea with Robert Abbott himself, and
got his permission to include it in a book project that was never completed.
Minor Confusion was OK, but a bit dry. We eventually moved on to playing other
games.

### Nov 2022 - Masquerade Chess
15 years after Minor Confusion, I had the idea to give pieces different moves
when capturing. Standard chess pieces would move normally, except when they
capture, and you have to deduce their capture moves. You have to engage with
your opponent to learn anything, and that spreads the deduction over a longer
game.

### May 2023 - Zombie Chess
After several successful playtests, I started thinking about whether I could
make a version of Masquerade Chess to sell. It seemed silly to try and sell the
chess set, so I thought about making the accessories to add to a standard chess
set: a dry-erase screen to secretly record which pieces have which capture
moves.

It seemed like it would be easier to sell, if you could play more than one game
with it, so I tried to think of other chess variants with hidden information
that could use a dry-erase screen. I had the idea to secretly bury the captured
pieces on the board, and Zombie Chess was born.

### Jun 2023 - Chess Kit
After two successful ideas, I decided to turn them into another book project,
similar to [Donimoes], my collection of new domino games and puzzles. I came up
with eight ideas over a couple of weeks.

### Oct 2023 - Cooperative Chess
I had a successful playtest of Crowded House, and wrote up its rules, along with
Chess960. I spent the most time, though, testing Cooperative Chess as a
solitaire.

I also converted the scripts for publishing the Donimoes rules as PDF and
website to this project.

### Nov 2023 - Adrenaline Chess
Started with Manna Chess, where manna drops randomly after each capture, and
gives the piece carrying it one extra king move. Players found the random drops
annoying, so we switched to Adrenaline Chess, where you choose which opposing
piece to give an adrenaline boost to after each capture. Made for some
interesting tactics of giving the boost to a piece you could capture it back
from.

### Dec 2023 - Chess Golf
Started with Neighbour Chess Solitaire, where the pieces borrow their
neighbour's move, and then merged it with Ricochet Robots to make Chess Golf.
Struggled with the mechanics of automatically adding pieces back to the board
and what to do when a colour has no neighbouring pairs. Fixed it by adding
special moves that can be done any time, but are expensive.
