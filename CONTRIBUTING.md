## Contributing
If you like Chess Kit and want to make it better, help out. It could be as
simple as sending [@donkirkby@hachyderm.io] a nice note on Mastodon, you could
report a problem, or pitch in with some playtesting or design work.

### Problems
Found a typo or a problem with the rules? Create a [GitHub issue], and be as
specific as possible.

### New Games
Do you have an idea for another game to include in Chess Kit or a favourite
Chess variant? Create an issue, and describe how it would work.

### Testing GitHub Pages locally
The web site uses the [Bulma Clean theme], which is based on [Bulma]. The
[Bulma colours] can be particularly helpful to learn about.

GitHub generates all the web pages from markdown files, but it can be useful to
test out that process before you commit changes. See the detailed instructions
for setting up [Jekyll], but the main command is this:

    cd docs
    bundle exec jekyll serve
