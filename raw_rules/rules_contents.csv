Zombie Chess,"is a game where you bury each piece you capture under one of your pieces. If you move off a buried piece, it comes back from the dead as a zombie. (2 players, chess set, coins, pencils, and paper)"
Masquerade Chess,"is a combination of chess and deduction games like Mastermind. Pieces move regularly, except when they capture. Start the game by choosing which capture moves each of your opponent's pieces will use, then try to deduce how each of your pieces can capture. (2 players, chess set, pencils, and paper)"
Crowded House,"is the only four-player game I know of on a standard chess set. (4 players and chess set)"
