### Introduction
These are new games that aren't ready yet. You can try them out and let me
know what you think.

## Crowded House
Two teams of two play, with each player moving the pieces of their colour
on the left or right half of the board. As usual, white moves first, then
alternates with black. Each king-side player takes the first move for their
team, then alternates with their partner. As an example, imagine Walter plays
king-side white, Winnie plays queen-side white, Betty plays king-side black, and
Bob plays queen-side black. Then the play order would be Walter, Betty, Winnie,
Bob, Walter, Betty, and so on.

### Rule changes
The key rule is that you can only move a piece that either starts or ends on
your side of the board. In this example, queen-side white may move the bishop as
shown, because it ends up on the queen side of the board. Moving the bishop to
e2 would not be allowed, because it would start and end on the king side.

The rest of the rule changes flow from whether a piece may be captured
immediately. A king may move into check or castle out of check, if the next
player can't make the capture. En passant capture only works if the pawn is
captured immediately after its first move.

### Talking
This is a silly game, so feel free to chat with your partner, but remember that
the other team is listening. Any discussion should be heard by both teams, so
no secret codes or second languages! Of course, players should also feel free to
ignore their partner's advice.

If partners are giving too much advice or want a more challenging game, add a
chess clock. Decide on an overall time, then decide on a time cost for talking.
As an example, you might play with a start time of 30 minutes and a 2-minute
bonus for each time your opponents talk. It's probably easiest to put a handful
of coins next to the board. Whenever your team discusses a move, either move a
coin from the centre to your opponents' pile or from your pile to the centre. If
a team runs out of time, they can add 2 minutes for each coin in their pile and
put their pile back in the centre. Once a team pays a coin, they can discuss as
much as they want until they make a move.

## Cloak and Dagger Chess
Start with pawns in their regular positions, but replace all other pieces with
numbered checkers. Then write down numbers and positions of other pieces. Pieces
move normally, and you have to deduce which of your opponent's pieces are which,
then capture their king.

At the start of your turn, you may guess the identity of one of your opponent's
cloaked pieces. If you guess correctly, you make two moves in the current turn.
If you guess incorrectly, your turn is over.

At the end of your turn, you may replace any number of your checkers with their
uncloaked chess pieces.

## Chess 960
A variant invented by Bobby Fischer to [generate][generate] random starting
positions. You can also generate random starting positions with a
[deck of cards][deck of cards]. Castling rules use standard ending locations.
